Prompt Engineering:

Prompt engineering refers to crafting prompts(instructions)  given to large language models(LLMs) to get desired responses.
Prompt engineering refers to crafting effective prompts to guide the language model towards the intended response. By refining your prompts, you can achieve better results and guide the model towards generating more accurate and useful responses.

Zero Shot Prompting:
In zero-shot prompting, the model gets a prompt without examples and responds based on its existing knowledge. This is ideal for quick, simple tasks.

One Shot Prompting:
In one-shot prompting, we provide one question-answer example, helping the model learn a specific format or style. This is useful for consistent outputs. 

Few Shot Prompting:
In few-shot prompting, we give the model multiple examples. This is useful for complex tasks requiring more context. For instance, for sentiment analysis, we provide sample texts with their classifications,and the model uses the categories to classify new texts.
